# The Rhizome Project

 The Rhizome protocol provides distributed and decentralized code execution that is robust to system and network 
 failures. 

## About

The Rhyzome protocol allows for robust, distributed execution of stateful functions.

The Rhyzome network consists of multiple nodes which can accept functions to execute. At defined points during 
execution, the state of the functions can be broadcasted across the network to the other nodes. If one node goes down
or experiences a fault, another node can resume execution from the last shared state.

## Setup

0. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/scottbarnesg/rhizome.git`
1. Install the pip package: `python -m pip install .`
2. See the `examples` directory for example usage of the code.

## Q&A

What is a rhyzome?

- The concept of a [Rhyzome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_(philosophy)) in this project is inspired by 
Deleuze and Guattari's _[A Thousand Plateaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Thousand_Plateaus)_.
